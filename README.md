The study investigates the anuran anatomical specializations of limbs and pelvis for different movement modes. Locomotor performance is critical for fitness as it determines the efficiency of predators escaping [1]. It is suggested that jumping plays a key role in evolutionary success [2]. Nevertheless, Anurans acquired a wide range of skeletal structures, habitats and locomotor modes (e.g. jumping and hopping, which differ in relative jumping distance [3]). The aim of this work is to examine how skeletal anatomy in anurans is affected by locomotor and phylogenetic demands. 

This work examined the relationship between anatomical features, ecological factors, and evolutionary history. Using regression models and PCA, we identified the morphological features contributing most to variation. This analysis revealed the extent to which locomotor mode and phylogenetic demands impact anuran skeletal anatomy.
