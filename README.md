The study investigates the anuran anatomical specializations of limbs and pelvis for different movement modes. Locomotor performance is critical for fitness as it determines the efficiency of predators escaping [1]. Locomotor performance is critical for fitness as it influences the ability to evade predators [1]. While jumping is hypothesized to play a key role in the evolutionary success of anurans [2], these species have evolved diverse skeletal structures, habitats, and locomotor modes—such as jumping and hopping, which differ in relative jumping distance [3]. This project aims to examine how anural skeletal anatomy is affected by locomotor and phylogenetic demands. 

This work examined the relationship between anatomical features, ecological factors, and evolutionary history. Using regression models and PCA, we identified the morphological features contributing most to variation. This analysis revealed the extent to which locomotor mode and phylogenetic demands impact anuran skeletal anatomy.
